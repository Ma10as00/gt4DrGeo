* Handling of Cuis stock image
Never save the stock Cuis image, alternatively save it with a different name. 
`git status` should always be "clean".

** To resync with stock image
Just doing `git pull` should be enough.
In case the stock image is dirty do:
git checkout Cuis6.0.xxxx.changes
git pull
then git status should be clean

If dirty clone the repo again and start fresh

* Copy to clipboard
LibreOffice, need it to be copied by uri:
echo "file://`pwd`/resources/MyExports/testL.svg" |  xclip -i -selection "CLIPBOARD" -t text/uri-list
